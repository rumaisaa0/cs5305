# ## Graph Construction
# 
# Now, we build the graph from our components defined above.
# 
# The [StateGraph class](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api/#stategraph) is the graph class that we can use.
#  
# First, we initialize a StateGraph with the `State` class we defined above.
#  
# Then, we add our nodes and edges.
# 
# We use the  [`START` Node, a special node](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api/#start-node) that sends user input to the graph, to indicate where to start our graph.
#  
# The [`END` Node](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api/#end-node) is a special node that represents a terminal node. 
# 
# Finally, we [compile our graph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api/#compiling-your-graph) to perform a few basic checks on the graph structure. 
# 
# We can visualize the graph as a [Mermaid diagram](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid).

# COMMAND ----------
from IPython.display import Image, display
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Build graph
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
builder.add_node("node_2", node_2)
builder.add_node("node_3", node_3)

# Logic
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_conditional_edges("node_1", decide_mood)
builder.add_edge("node_2", END)
builder.add_edge("node_3", END)

# Add
graph = builder.compile()

# View
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

# COMMAND ---------- [markdown]
# ## Graph Invocation
# 
# The compiled graph implements the [runnable](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/?h=runnables) protocol.
# 
# This provides a standard way to execute LangChain components. 
#  
# `invoke` is one of the standard methods in this interface.
# 
# The input is a dictionary `{"graph_state": "Hi, this is lance."}`, which sets the initial value for our graph state dict.
# 
# When `invoke` is called, the graph starts execution from the `START` node.
# 
# It progresses through the defined nodes (`node_1`, `node_2`, `node_3`) in order.
# 
# The conditional edge will traverse from node `1` to node `2` or `3` using a 50/50 decision rule. 
# 
# Each node function receives the current state and returns a new value, which overrides the graph state.
# 
# The execution continues until it reaches the `END` node.

# COMMAND ----------
graph.invoke({"graph_state" : "Hi, this is Ali."})

# COMMAND ---------- [markdown]
# `invoke` runs the entire graph synchronously.
# 
# This waits for each step to complete before moving to the next.
# 
# It returns the final state of the graph after all nodes have executed.
# 
# In this case, it returns the state after `node_3` has completed: 
# 
# ```
# {'graph_state': 'Hi, this is Lance. I am sad!'}
# ```
